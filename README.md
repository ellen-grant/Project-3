# Cognitive Decline in the United States (US)


# Overview

   Using data from the CDC on Alzheimers and Healthy Aging, we have created a map of the United States (US) to analyze cognitive decline and different factors that might be associated. The factors analyzed include age, race/ethnicity, gender, and location. The map shows the density of the population of a state that is affected by cognitive decline, as well as statistics like population, percentage of population affected, etc. It is also able to be filtered by age, race/ethnicity, gender, and location to give insight on who is affected or most likely to experience cognitive decline in the US. The map can also provide insight into where in the US the affected might be concentrated, if any correlation is present.

# Ethical Considerations

   In data analysis and this project, ethical considerations are crucial to ensuring that the process is accurate, transparent, and fair. As analysts, we need to handle data responsibly, especially when dealing with sensitive or personal information, making sure to protect privacy and avoid bias. Misrepresenting data, whether through manipulation or selective reporting, can lead to misleading conclusions that negatively impact decision-making. An example of this was the decision to include data on whether or not someone had spoken with a healthcare professional about their subjective cognitive decline. We thought it was unethical to exclude this data, due to factors in socio-economic, race, and gender that might prevent or inhibit an individual from having access to healthcare. It is also important to adhere to legal and regulatory standards while using data ethically to benefit everyone involved.
