# Cognitive Decline in the United States (US)

Using data from the CDC on Alzheimers and Healthy Aging, we have created a map of the United States (US) to analyze cognitive decline and different facots that might be associated. The factors analyzed include age, race/ethnicity, gender, and location. The map shows the density of the population of a state that is affected by cognitive decline, as well as statistics like population, percentage of population affected, etc. It is also able to be filtered by age, race/ethnicity, gender, and location to give insiht on who is or most likely to be affected by cognitive decline in the US. The map can also provide insight into where in the US the affect might be concentrated, if any correlation is present.
